## Permission Matrix

| Operation | Authoring entrypoint | Authoring methods | Compiled slots | Typical meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read | `allowRead` | `.always()` `.never()` `.where(...)` | `using` | Which existing rows can be read |
| Insert | `allowInsert` | `.always()` `.never()` `.where(...)` | `with_check` | Which new rows may be inserted |
| Update | `allowUpdate` | `.always()` `.never()` `.where(...)` `.whereOld(...)` `.whereNew(...)` | `using` + `with_check` | Which existing rows may be updated, and what the updated row must still satisfy |
| Delete | `allowDelete` | `.always()` `.never()` `.where(...)` | `using` | Which existing rows may be deleted |

## Authoring Matrix

| Operation | `.always()` | `.never()` | `.where(...)` | `.whereOld(...)` | `.whereNew(...)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allowRead` | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| `allowInsert` | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| `allowUpdate` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `allowDelete` | yes | yes | yes | no | no |

## Compiled Slots Matrix

| Operation | `using` | `with_check` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `select` | yes | no | `using` gates which existing rows are visible |
| `insert` | no | yes | `with_check` validates the new row |
| `update` | yes | yes | `using` checks the current row, `with_check` checks the updated row |
| `delete` | yes | no | `using` gates which existing rows may be removed |

## Hierarchy

| Level | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| table | one table has four operations |
| operation | `Read`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete` |
| compiled slot | `using` and/or `with_check` |
| expression tree | `True`, comparisons, inheritance, existence, boolean logic |

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `managedByCreator()` | Convenience helper for creator-owned row policies across read, insert, update, and delete |

## Authoring Condition Families

| Family | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| direct column checks | `{ owner_id: session.user_id }` |
| logical composition | `allOf(...)`, `anyOf(...)` |
| session checks | `session.where({ "claims.role": "manager" })` |
| inherited access | `allowedTo.read("project")`, `allowedTo.update("parent")` |
| existence checks | `policy.todoShares.exists.where(...)` |

## Compiled Expression Matrix

| Compiled node | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `True` | always allowed |
| `False` | never allowed |
| `Cmp` | compare a column to a value |
| `SessionCmp` | compare session data to a literal value |
| `IsNull` | column is null |
| `IsNotNull` | column is not null |
| `SessionIsNull` | session path is null |
| `SessionIsNotNull` | session path is not null |
| `Contains` | column contains a value |
| `SessionContains` | session value contains a literal |
| `In` | column value exists in a session path |
| `InList` | column value exists in a list of values |
| `SessionInList` | session value exists in a list of literal values |
| `Exists` | matching row exists in another table |
| `ExistsRel` | matching related row exists |
| `Inherits` | inherit permission through a referenced row |
| `InheritsReferencing` | inherit permission from referencing rows |
| `And` | all child expressions must match |
| `Or` | any child expression may match |
| `Not` | negate a child expression |

## Inspector Mapping

| Question | Backed by |
| --- | --- |
| can this table be read? | `select.using` |
| can new rows be inserted? | `insert.with_check` |
| can rows generally be updated? | `update.using` + `update.with_check` |
| can rows generally be deleted? | `delete.using` |

## Safe Inspector Outputs

| UI layer | What to show |
| --- | --- |
| summary | operation status |
| structure | `using` / `with_check` presence |
| detail | compiled rule tree |
| debug | raw JSON |
